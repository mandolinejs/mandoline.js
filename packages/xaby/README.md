# xaby: a minimal framework for accessible interfaces

4 basic input controls, introduced one at a time:

## x: i exist!
```treeml.text
push `x` to announce your continuing presence
            ask "what can i do?"
```

## a: i act!
```treeml.text
push `a` to announce your intent
            take an action
            step forward
            zoom in
```

## b: i observe!
```treeml.text
push `b` to look around
            ask "where am i?"
                "who else is here?"
```

## y: i wonder why!
```treeml.text
push `y` to reflect on your past
            pull back
            ask "where have i been?"
                "what have i done?"
                "what could i have done instead?"
```
